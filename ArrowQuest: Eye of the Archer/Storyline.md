# Storyline:

The town of Khemar is situated in the middle of nowhere. A traditional Egyptian town, surrounded by blistering sandstorms and golden dunes is home to 150 townsfolk. The weather here is simple, harsh summers and occasional rains. It was not a rich and flourishing town, but once known for its prosperity and calm. But ever since the Rebellion of Gods started, the town and its people plunged into a period of darkness. The lands all over Egypt was ravaged by constant plagues. Death and Destruction came in the form of pests, monsters, plagues, and darkness. The Sun seemed to get dimmer each day.

The reason for the Rebellion and the deaths was Set, the God of Death and Destruction. He was the brother of Osiris but was denied the throne to rule over all life. Instead, Osiris’s son, Horus was crowned the king of Egypt. Raging with anger and jealousy, Set made a choice. He gathered the rogue gods, Anubis, Ammit and Sekmet to kill Horus. But later, he did something different.  The Eye of Horus is also said to symbolize the sun and light and is considered a symbol of protection for the living and the dead. It is said to be effective against enchantment, betrayal, disease, and the evil eye, making it the most powerful artifact all over Egypt. If Horus loses the eye, the lands will plunge into darkness, making it easy for him to usurp the throne. Finally Set, led a rebellion to attack the gods and stole the eye from Horus, thereby fulfilling his dream. Once the Sun crosses the Horizon, the lands will have reshaped, making it Set’s kingdom. The people of Egypt had only a month to live.

But even amongst this turmoil, a man rose from the slums of Khemar. He was not a soldier or a great warrior, but a simple archer enriched in his skills and his father’s knowledge. Steven was an ordinary citizen, aspiring to become a great archer. Now, with the fate of his town hanging in the balance, Steven embarks on a quest that will test his courage, resilience, and determination like never before.

As Steven sets out, he is met by Arthur, the old forger in the town. He gifts him a bow, the Sandstorm’s Whisper, and a few arrows. Arthur leaves the town, nowhere to be seen. As Steven sets out from the humble confines of his home, the blistering sun beats down upon him, its fiery rays mirroring the intensity of his resolve. With his trusty bow slung across his back and a quiver of arrows at his side, he strides purposefully into the vast expanse of the desert, guided by the flickering light of the distant horizon.

Along the way, Steven encounters allies who share his noble cause, each possessing unique talents and skills that complement his own. Among them is Layla, a witch skilled in the art of healing and poisons, whose unwavering loyalty and determination serve as a source of strength for Steven in the face of adversity. Together, they brave the treacherous terrain, navigating ancient ruins and crumbling temples in search of clues that will lead them to their goal.

To get back the eye of Horus, Steven had to get to the Pyramid of Pharaoh’s Fury, crossing five strongholds. Each stronghold has its soldiers and a boss, who needs to be defeated to get to the next place. Therefore, Steven gets across The Walls of Khemar, The Tomb of the Sun King, The Temple of the Sphinx, The Valley of Osiris, and The Sands of Anubis. Once defeating the bosses and gaining knowledge and new bows, Steven goes to fight Set and retrieve the eye.

At the final pyramid, he encounters the guards of Set and a surprise. Arthur faces against Steven, with the legendary bow of Ra, the Sun God. After defeating Arthur, Steven faces Set, who traps Layla and then finally defeats Set and retrieves the eye.

The God Horus arrives to greet Steven and get his eye. He frees Layla and then frees Egypt of its curse and plague. Once again the town is happy and Steven is respected as the great warrior who defeated Set and brought peace to Egypt.
